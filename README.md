# Automated-EDA
The primary goals of this project are to streamline the EDA process by automating the pre-processing steps and providing a detailed visualization dashboard that caters to different column types. Key objectives include:
- Automating data pre-processing to save time and reduce manual errors.
- Creating a comprehensive visualization dashboard that supports a wide range of data visualizations, such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, tailored to the specific needs of each column type.
- Enabling support for various data formats, including CSV, Excel, and SQL databases, allowing for a broader range of data to be analyzed with ease.
- Implementing advanced data pre-processing techniques, including missing value handling, categorical feature encoding, and numerical feature scaling, to prepare data for insightful analysis.
- Offering tools for feature selection and dimensionality reduction to help users focus on the most relevant data for their analysis.
- Leveraging Python's powerful visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn to produce interactive and engaging data visualizations.
